# Welcome to MegaGiant's Scratch Screensavers
### In this repository i put a bunch of my screensavers that I made in scratch.

## How to get them?
You can just open them in your browser, press F11 and watch it do stuff.

## I want to use them as my actual screensaver, how do I do that?
They are usually avabile on my scratch profile @MegaGiant123, you can use https://packager.turbowarp.org/ to package them using electron, change the .exe file to a .scr and right click > install. (i have not tested the install, but screensavers are just programs)

## Can I change them?
Yes! Just go on the scratch project, copy the ID and on turbowarp edit them. File > package project and viola! You can even publish them in your repositories, i'll be more than happy to check them out.
